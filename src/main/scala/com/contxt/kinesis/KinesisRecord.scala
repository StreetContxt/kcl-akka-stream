    * the last processed record. However, if a record is not processed (for example, because of an exception), then no
    * further records after it can be checkpointed.
    *
    * KinesisSource keeps track of all the uncheckpointed records and their ordering. This means you can process records
    * out of order in an asynchronous fashion. Each record must be eventually marked as processed by calling
    * `markProcessed()`, or the steam must be terminated with an exception. If the stream continues after failing to
    * process a record, and not marking it as processed, then no further records can be checkpointed, eventually causing
    * the system to run out of memory.
